# Flask-shared-folder

This project is the solution to a problem I have been having for a while now. I recently got myself an Ipad, and my laptop is a windows machine, and when I wanted to transfer files between each device, I found I had to email myself or do really inefficent methods. So I developed this software that hosts only one folder on my laptop that can be accessed by other devices nearby.

There are several security concerns, as any device could access the contents, so I recommend that you try this in a trusted private network. In the future, this could be nitigated by usng SSL certification or other encrytion standards. Making this into an app would also make the entire upload and download process more seemless
